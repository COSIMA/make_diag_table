# This yaml file is used by make_diag_table.py to create a diag_table file specifying MOM5 diagnostics.
# Latest version: https://github.com/COSIMA/make_diag_table

# Define the diagnostics you want in the diag_table section below.

# The MOM diag_table format is defined here:

# Define global default settings which will be applied to all diagnostics,
# unless overridden in diag_table section below, either in defaults or individual fields.
# You're unlikely to need to change any of the global_defaults.

    file_name:  # file name (without trailing ".nc") is constructed from these components,
    # separated by file_name_separator, as per https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2/issues/185
    # All these components (other than field_name) must be names that exist in global_defaults.

    output_freq_units: months  # time units for output: years, months, days, hours, minutes, or seconds
    file_format: 1  # integer, must be 1, specifying NetCDF (the only format currently supported)
    time_axis_units: days  # time units for the output file time axis: years, months, days, hours, minutes, or seconds
    time_axis_name: time  # must be "time" (case-insensitive)
    new_file_freq:  # optional integer: frequency (in new_file_freq_units) for closing the existing file, and creating a new file
    new_file_freq_units:  # time units for new_file_freq: years, months, days, hours, minutes, or seconds (optional; required if and only if new_file_freq specified)
    start_time:  # Time to start the file for the first time. The format of this string is the same as base_date (optional; requires new_file_freq, new_file_freq_units)
    file_duration:  # integer: How long file should receive data after start time (optional; requires new_file_freq, new_file_freq_units, start_time)
    file_duration_units:  # units for file_duration: years, months, days, hours, minutes, or seconds (optional; required if and only if file_duration specified)
# field section:
    module_name: ocean_model
    field_name:  # set via keys in the fields section of the diag_table section below

    reduction_method: average
    # reduction_method options:
    #     average: Average from the last time written to the current time.
    #     none or snap: No reduction performed.  Write current time step value only. Becomes "none" in diag_table.
    #     rms: Calculate the root mean square from the last time written to the current time.
    #     pow##: Calculate the mean of the power ## from the last time written to the current time.
    #     min: Minimum value from last write to current time.
    #     max: Maximum value from last write to current time.
    #     diurnal##: ## diurnal averages
    regional_section: none  # string: bounds of the regional section to capture ("none" indicates a global region). String format: lat_min, lat_max, lon_min, lon_max, vert_min, vert_max. Use vert_min = -1 and vert_max = -1 to get the entire vertical axis.
    packing: 2
    # packing is the Fortran number KIND of the data written:
    #     1: double precision
    #     2: float (single precision)
    #     4: packed 16-bit integers
    #     8: packed 1-byte (not tested)

    file_name_date: "%4yr%2mo%2dy"  # run date/time of file opening; format: %, 1 digit (#digits), one of (yr, mo, dy, hr, mi, sc); date/time components will be separated by _ in filename.
    file_name_separator: "-"  # used to separate filename components; best not to use "_" to avoid confusion with fields and dates
    file_name_omit_empty: true  # whether to omit empty filename components to avoid duplicate file_name_separator
    file_name_substitutions:  # string replacements for filename components

# diag_table section - this defines the diagnostics that will appear in diag_table.
# 
# Top-level categories in diag_table have arbitrary names (they're just used for
# comments in the output diag_table). Make as many of these as you like to group
# similar diagnostics with shared defaults. Note that each of the top-level
# categories can have only have one instance of each field name, so if you need
# multiple outputs of the same field (e.g. as both averages and snapshots), youâ€™ll
# need to make additional categories.
# 
# Within each top-level category there's an optional defaults section and a
# fields section. The defaults section overrides items in global_defaults for
# all fields in the category. The field section specifies diagnostic field
# names. To add a new diagnostic, all you need to do is add its name to the
# field section in the appropriate category. Each field name can be followed by
# a dictionary overriding the category and global defaults for that field only.
# 
# Some of the available diagnostics are listed here:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/COSIMA/access-om2/master/MOM_diags.txt
